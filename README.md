## Steps to Create the Dashboard

1. **Data Import and Preparation**
   - Load the `Orders`, `People`, and `Return` tables into your chosen data visualization tool.
   - Clean and format data to ensure consistency across columns (e.g., date formats, null values).
   - Create relationships between tables based on relevant keys (e.g., `Order ID`).

2. **Create Calculated Fields**
   - Develop calculated fields to generate key metrics, such as:
     - Total Sales: `Sum([Sales])`
     - Total Profit: `Sum([Profit])`
     - Total Quantity: `Sum([Quantity])`
     - Number of Orders: `Count([Order ID])`
     - Profitability: `Sum([Profitability])`
     - Average Discount: `Average([Discount])`

3. **Building the KPI Table**

     | Total Quantity    | Sum of Quantity        | üì¶     |
     | Number of Orders  | Count of Order ID      | üõí     |
     | Profitability     | Sum of Profitability   | üíπ     |
     | Average Discount  | Average of Discount    | üîç     |

   - **Market Share by Region:** Pie or doughnut charts showing market share contributions of each region.
   - **Sub-Category Contribution:** Bar charts displaying the contribution of top-performing sub-categories to overall sales.

5. **Interactivity and Filters**
   - Add filters to allow users to slice and dice data based on different dimensions like date range, market, region, segment, etc.
